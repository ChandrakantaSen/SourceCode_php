ILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL Email Address Validation Examples

Assuming $email_address holds the address to be checked, you could try its validity using:

<?php
$email_address = "me@example.com";
if (filter_var($email_address, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {
  // The email address is valid
} else {
  // The email address is not valid
}
?>

You can also filter an email address straight from the web form (assuming the email address was captured in field with the name "email"):

<?php
$email_address = filter_input(INPUT_GET, 'email', FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL);
if (!$email_address) {
  // The email address is not valid
}
?>
